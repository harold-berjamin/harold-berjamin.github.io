A simple strain-rate viscoelasticity model of isotropic soft solid is introduced. The constitutive equations account for finite strain, incompressibility, material frame-indifference, nonlinear elasticity, and viscous dissipation. A nonlinear viscous wave equation for the shear strain is obtained exactly, and a corresponding one-way Burgers-type equation is derived by making standard approximations. Analysis of the travelling wave solutions shows that the two partial differential equations produce distinct solutions, and that deviations are exacerbated when wave amplitudes are not arbitrarily small. In the elastic limit, the one-way approximate wave equation can be linked to simple wave theory, thus allowing direct error measurements.
