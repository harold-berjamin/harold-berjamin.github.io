Propagation of elastic waves in damaged media (concrete, rocks) is studied theoretically and numerically. Such materials exhibit a nonlinear behavior, with long-time softening and recovery processes (slow dynamics). A constitutive model combining Murnaghan hyperelasticity with the slow dynamics is considered, where the softening is represented by the evolution of a scalar variable. The equations of motion in the Lagrangian framework are detailed. These equations are rewritten as a nonlinear hyperbolic system of balance laws, which is solved numerically using a finite-volume method with flux limiters. Numerical examples illustrate specific features of nonlinear elastic waves, as well as the effect of the materialâ€™s softening. In particular, the generation of solitary waves in a periodic layered medium is illustrated numerically.
