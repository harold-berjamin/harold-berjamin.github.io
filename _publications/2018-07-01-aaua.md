A numerical method for longitudinal wave propagation in nonlinear elastic solids is presented. Here, we consider polynomial stress-strain relationships, which are widely used in nondestructive evaluation. The large-strain and infinitesimal-strain constitutive laws deduced from Murnaghanâ€™s law are detailed, and polynomial expressions are obtained. The Lagrangian equations of motion yield a hyperbolic system of conservation laws. The latter is solved numerically using a finite-volume method with flux limiters based on Roe linearization. The method is tested on the Riemann problem, which yields nonsmooth solutions. The method is then applied to a continuum model with one scalar internal variable, accounting for the softening of the material (slow dynamics).
