Viscoelastic and poroelastic wave propagation in nonlinear soft tissues

In this talk, I will give an overview of recent results obtained during my first postdoctoral fellowship at NUI Galway (Ireland), covering several topics related to wave propagation in soft solids. The broader context of these works is the study of Traumatic Brain Injury, which is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. First, the propagation of nonlinear plane waves in viscoelastic solids will be addressed, including thermodynamic aspects and shock formation. Then, fluid-saturated porous media will be considered. Ongoing and future developments will also be presented.
