The study of pre-stressed phononic crystals was conducted in my 2022 <i>Int. J. Solids Struct.</i> [publication](/publication/2022-02-26-ijss), see Figure. Computations show that accounting for dissipation shifts the band gaps (i.e., the frequency range in which waves cannot propagate), simultaneously increasing their width. The control of these effective dynamic properties by application of a magnetic field based on the exploitation of magnetoelastic material behaviour is the scope of further research, see my 2025 <i>Int. J. Solids Struct.</i> [publication](/publication/2025-04-17-ijss) on the subject. A detailed analysis of nonlinear wave propagation in magneto-active layered media can be found in my <i>Int. J. Eng. Sci.</i> [publication](/publication/2025-08-31-ijes).
