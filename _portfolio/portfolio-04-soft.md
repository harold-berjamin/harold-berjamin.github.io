In relation with my research works on traumatic brain injury, I investigated several aspects of the modelling and characterisation of soft biological tissues. More specifically, I studied the propagation of shear waves in pre-stressed viscoelastic media, see the 2022 <i>Int. J. Solids Struct.</i> publication. Using these results, I adapted an experimental technique to measure the amount of mechanical stress in a material based on the propagation of two shear waves, see <i>Extreme Mech. Lett.</i> [paper](/_publications/2024-02-23-eml). Experimental measurements are currently being performed on various samples using the theory presented in a recent <i>Math. Mech. Solids</i> [publication](/_publications/2024-03-13-mms). Finally, I also became interested in the modelling of static torsional motions in soft porous solids (see study published in <i>Int. J. Non-Linear Mech.</i> [publication](/_publications/2023-12-06-nlm)).
