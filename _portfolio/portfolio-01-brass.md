During a two-month research internship, I worked on a physical model of brass musical instrument (Figure). I developed a time-domain numerical tool for the simulation of nonlinear sound waves, which combines variable cross-section, viscothermal losses and a model for the musicianâ€™s lips. Numerical examples show that the nonlinearity of wave propagation in the bore has a major influence on the properties of the numerical instrument. The results were published in <i>Acta Acustica united with Acustica</i> (2017) [link](/publication/2017-01-01-aaua).
