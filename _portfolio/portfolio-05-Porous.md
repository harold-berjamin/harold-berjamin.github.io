In view of future applications in brain mechanics, I also became interested in finite-strain models of soft poroelastic solids (Biot-Coussy mixture theory). In this context, I studied the propagation of plane waves in incompressible fluid saturated porous media. The analysis highlights the existence of a nonlinear poroelastic compression wave, and the evolution of corresponding nonlinear acceleration waves is described. The main result is that the poroelastic compression wave has a strong nonlinear evolution, while shear waves evolve in a quasi linearly degenerate fashion, cf. the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society A</i> (2021) [link](/publication/2021-06-02-prsa). Ongoing works are of computational nature.
