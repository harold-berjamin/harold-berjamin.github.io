My PhD research was dedicated to the modelling of stiffness variations in vibrating geomaterials such as rocks or concrete (Figure). In that context, I derived a mathematical model within the framework of continuum thermo-mechanics with internal variables of state. The model follows a phenomenological approach and is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations (see the 2017 <i>Proc. R. Soc. A</i> [publication](/publication/2017-05-31-prsa) and also the [thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01977206)). Computational developments aimed at reproducing experimental results numerically then led to additional publications (3 journal articles, [1](/publication/2018-06-01-ijss)-[2](/publication/2018-07-01-aaua)-[3](/publication/2019-03-13-wamot), 2 conference proceedings, 1 book chapter). For these works, I designed and implemented dedicated finite volume schemes to compute nonlinear wave solutions accurately.
