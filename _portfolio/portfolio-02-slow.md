My PhD research was dedicated to the modelling of stiffness variations in vibrating geomaterials such as rocks or concrete. In that context, I derived a mathematical model within the framework of continuum thermo-mechanics with internal variables of state. The model follows a phenomenological approach and is qualitatively consistent with experimental observations. We published the results in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society A</i> (2017) [link](/publication/2017-05-31-prsa). Computational developments aimed at reproducing experimental results then led to additional publications (3 journal articles, 2 conference proceedings, 1 book chapter). For these works, I designed and implemented dedicated finite volume schemes to compute nonlinear wave solutions accurately.
