In relation with my research works on traumatic brain injury, I investigated several aspects of the modelling and characterisation of soft biological tissues. More specifically, I studied the propagation of shear waves in pre-stressed viscoelastic media, see the 2022 <i>Int. J. Solids Struct.</i> [publication](/publication/2022-02-26-ijss). Using these results, I adapted an experimental technique to measure the amount of mechanical stress in a material based on the propagation of two shear waves, see my 2024 [publication](/publication/2024-02-23-eml) in <i>Extreme Mech. Lett.</i> Experimental measurements are currently being performed on polymer tissue phantoms using the fractional viscoelasticity theory presented in the 2025 <i>Math. Mech. Solids</i> [paper](/publication/2025-02-01-mms).

In the context of torsional mechanical tests performed on soft porous cylinders (e.g., cylindrical samples of brain tissue or liver tissue), my 2024 <i>Int. J. Non-Linear Mech.</i> [publication](/publication/2023-12-06-nlm) shows that the porosity is responsible for a slight compressibility effect. However, the fluid motion in the pores does not qualitatively affect the relationship between the torque and the vertical normal force applied to the sample.
