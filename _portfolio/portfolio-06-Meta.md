Application of the acoustoelasticity theory to the study of pre-stressed phononic crystals was explored in the 2022 <i>Int. J. Solids Struct.</i> [publication](/publication/2022-02-26-ijss.md), see Figure. Computations show that accounting for dissipation shifts the band gaps (i.e., the frequency range in which waves cannot propagate), simultaneously increasing their width. The control of these effective dynamic properties by application of a magnetic field based on the exploitation of magnetoelastic material behaviour is the scope of current research.
