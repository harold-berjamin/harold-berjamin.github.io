After I completed my PhD, I became interested in finite-strain models of soft viscoelastic solids (Fungâ€™s QLV theory). In this context, I established the dissipative character of the model by deriving the expression of the thermodynamic potential in terms of appropriate state variables. The results were published in <i>Mechanics Research Communications</i> (2021) [link](/publication/2020-12-05-mrc). Ongoing works concern the small-on-large acoustoelasticity theory, and the formation of shock waves.
