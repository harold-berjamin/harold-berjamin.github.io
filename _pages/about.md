I have joined [NUI Galway](http://www.nuigalway.ie/our-research/people/mathematics-statistics-and-applied-mathematics/haroldberjamin/) in 2019 to work as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Applied Mathematics with [Michel Destrade](http://www.maths.nuigalway.ie/~destrade/). My research concerns the propagation of mechanical waves in nonlinear materials (theoretical and numerical aspects). In particular, I study the nonlinear dynamic behavior of viscoelastic and poroelastic solids. This research has various applications in engineering, e.g. in geophysics, biomechanics, nondestructive testing and materials science.

My current [research project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101023950) concerns the subject of traumatic brain injury. You can contact me by email for opportunities, scientific discussions or communication requests.
