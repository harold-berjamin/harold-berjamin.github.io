About
======

My research concerns the propagation of mechanical waves in nonlinear materials (theoretical and numerical aspects). In particular, I study the nonlinear dynamic behavior of viscoelastic and poroelastic solids. This research has various applications in engineering, e.g. in geophysics, biomechanics, nondestructive testing and materials science.

Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher working with [Doireann O'Kiely](https://www.doireannokiely.com/) at the University of Limerick (Ireland).

I joined the University of Galway (Ireland) in 2019 to work as a postdoctoral fellow in Applied Mathematics with [Michel Destrade](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/science-engineering/school-of-maths/staff-profiles/academic/micheldestrade/). This [research project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101023950) concerned the subject of traumatic brain injury. It has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. Then, I was working with [Stephan Rudykh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gGiZAKUAAAAJ) in Galway as part of the [ERC project MAGIC](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/852281). This research addresses the modelling of soft magnetoactive materials.

You can contact me by email for opportunities, scientific discussions or communication requests. <em> Looking for job opportunities (Assistant Professor, Lecturer, Researcher, Scientist, R&D Engineer, Simulation Engineer). </em>
