Profile
======
I have joined [NUI Galway](http://www.nuigalway.ie/our-research/people/mathematics-statistics-and-applied-mathematics/haroldberjamin/) in 2019 as Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Applied Mathematics. My research concerns the propagation of mechanical waves in nonlinear materials (theoretical and numerical aspects). In particular, I study the nonlinear dynamic behavior of viscoelastic solids. This research has various applications in engineering, e.g. in geophysics, biomechanics, nondestructive testing and materials science.
