I have joined NUI Galway in 2019 as Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Applied Mathematics. I work on the propagation of mechanical waves in nonlinear materials. In particular, I study the nonlinear dynamic behavior of viscoelastic solids (theoretical and numerical aspects). This research has various applications in engineering, e.g. in geophysics, biomechanics, nondestructive testing and materials science.
